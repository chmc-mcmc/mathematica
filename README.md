Several ideas emerge during my academic visiting to Dr. Henry at UoW, and others in collaboration with Prof. Yang, and also from a question of a reviewer.

The method is suitable for general probability models, such as 1) potential energies of postive definite, negative definite, or indefinite; 2) very high correlation; 3) non-normality.

The basic idea is the trajectories from a family of kinetic energies can traverse all components of multivariate probability models.
